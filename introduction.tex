\chapter{About this Document\label{intro}}

This document is a supplement to the existing \xARCH System V
Application Binary Interface (ABI) document available at
\url{http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/abi386-4.pdf},
which describes the Linux IA-32 ABI for processors compatible with the
\xARCH Architecture.

Intel processors released after the Pentium processors (Pentium 4,
Intel Core, and later), have introduced new architecture features,
particularly new registers and corresponding instructions to operate on
the registers, like the MMX, Intel SSE(1-4), and Intel AVX instruction
set extensions. The C/C++ programming languages have evolved to allow
programmers to use new data types (for example, \code{__m64},
\code{__m128}, and \code{__m256}). Many compilers (including the Intel
compiler and GCC) have supported these data types for some time. Other
features in tools (for example, the decimal floating point types, 64-bit
integers, exception handling, and so on) have also been developed since
the original ABI was written.

This document describes the conventions and constraints on the
implementation of these new features for interoperability between
various tools.

\section{Scope}

This document describes the conventions on the new C/C++ language types
(including alignment and parameter passing conventions), the relocation
symbols in the object binary, and the exception handling mechanism for
\xARCH architecture.  Some of this work has been discussed before
\url{http://groups.google.com/group/ia32-abi} or
\url{http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf}. The C++ object model that
is expected to be followed is described in
\url{http://www.codesourcery.com/public/cxx-abi/abi.html}.  In particular,
this document specifies the information that compilers have to generate
and the library routines that do the frame unwinding for exception
handling.
